# HTAP
code rejects own personal project

Here we go, I hope you guys have learned and figured out how to use git.
Lets try to make this repo clean and well orginised.

I've taken the liberty of creating 3 branches corolating to each one of you,
branch names:

1)main (master)
2)Julian
3)Justin
4)Omar

the main (master) branch is where all the Official code will go once we checked,
debuged, optimised all the necessery elements.

the sidebranches with your names is your own branch you can do whatever you want on there.
experiment, test, and try out possible features. we can merge two side branches to one another,
to test merging code before merging them in the main master branch.

make sure before any possible merge to utilise the .gitignore file if you don't want any specific,
files to be staged and commited to the repo (you just add any file to the list of names,
and they will not be added to the commit). 

PS: DO NOT UPLOAD MEMES TO THE REPO !! lets keep this shit profesional
