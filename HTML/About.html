                How to avoid people (HTAP) is a first year project created by Omar Badawy, Julian Römer, and Justin Jaecks.
                the Project aims at creating a real time heat map of all students who are present on campus. Thus enabling
                other students to get a live view of how densily populated the campus is from home, and make an informed decision
                on whether or not to come to CODE campus to study or not. As well as act as a live booking service for students to
                book rooms rather than using google calendar. Utilising the google calendar AUT-2 API, HTAP will be able to update your
                personal calendar with any room booked at a specific time, which will eleviate any further effort from the students to 
                orginise their schedual.
